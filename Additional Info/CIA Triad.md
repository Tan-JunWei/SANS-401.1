### Confidentiality
Confidentiality - means that certain information should only be **known to certain people**

Violations of Confidentiality
- Direct attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to systems, applications, and databases in order to steal or tamper with data. E.g. Network reconnaissance and other types of scans, electronic eavesdropping via a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack, and escalation of system privileges by an attacker
  
- Can be violated unintentionally through human error, carelessness, or inadequate security controls. E.g Failure by users or IT security to adequately protect passwords

### Integrity
Integrity - means that the data is **stored and transferred as intended** and that any **modification is authorized**

Violations of Integrity
- Integrity can be compromised directly via an attack vector - the path that a hacker takes to exploit cybersecurity vulnerabilities. E.g. An attack vector can be tampering with intrusion detection systems (IDS), modifying configuration files, or changing system logs to evade detection

- Integrity can also be compromised unintentionally, through human error, lack of care, coding errors, or inadequate policies, procedures, and protection mechanisms.

### Availability
Availability - means that information is **accessible to those authorized to view or modify it**. It ensures that authorized users have timely, reliable access to resources when needed

Violations of Availability
- Hardware or software failure, power failure, natural disasters, and human error can jeopardize availability.
- The most well-known attack that threatens availability is the denial-of-service (DoS) attack, in which the performance of a system, website, web-based application, or web-based service is intentionally and maliciously degraded, or the system becomes completely unreachable.
