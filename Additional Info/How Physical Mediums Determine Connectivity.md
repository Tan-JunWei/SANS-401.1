### 1. **Physical Medium Determines Connectivity**

Each type of physical transmission medium (e.g., copper cables, fiber optics, radio waves) has inherent properties that influence how devices connect and communicate. The arrangement of these connections defines the network's topology. 

How different media might result in different topologies:

- **Copper Cables (limited distance)**: These mediums are commonly associated with star or bus topologies, where devices are directly wired together. For example, Ethernet cables in a LAN setup typically form a **star topology**, where all devices connect to a central switch or router.

- **Fiber Optic Cables (long distance, high capacity)**: Fiber can support long-distance, high-bandwidth communication, often forming **ring** or **mesh topologies** in wide area networks (WANs). These topologies help ensure redundancy and reliability.

- **Wireless (Radio Waves, Wi-Fi)**: Wireless communication, such as in Wi-Fi networks, often results in a **mesh topology**, where devices communicate with one another dynamically. It could also form a **point-to-point** or **star topology**, where all devices connect to a central access point.


Each medium shapes the structure of the network and hence determines the topology best suited to its characteristics.
