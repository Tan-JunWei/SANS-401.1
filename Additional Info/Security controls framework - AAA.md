The AAA system works in three chronological and dependent steps, where one must take place before the next can begin.
#### Authentication
- Create access lists and identification mechanisms to allow approved persons through barriers
- Passwordless authentication methods like [[Biometric security|biometrics]] could also be used
#### Authorization
- Create barriers around a resource so that access can be controlled through defined entry and exit points
#### Accounting
- Keep a record of when entry/exit points are used and detect security breaches
