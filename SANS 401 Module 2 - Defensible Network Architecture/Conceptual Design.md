-  High-level network overview
  
- Includes core components of a network architecture
	- internal and external systems, data flow, and overall system behavior
	  
- Will consider OS platforms, server services, critical core operational functions, etc.
  
- Helps to understand the overall purpose of a network (WHY we have it and WHAT it helps us to achieve)
	- [[Know Thy Systems]] (Network)
	- Not about how the systems are configured, but rather what systems we need to achieve our objectives (understanding the interdependency between those systems, and how end-users interact with those systems)
	- Once we understand these purposes, we can begin to determine criticality
		- criticality of assets
		- criticality of processes
		- criticality of processes
	- Some organizations take additional data into consideration for this design phase such as regulatory, legal, security, and safety concerns
    - These additional considerations aren't necessary at this phase of understanding they are, however, mentioned for completeness
      
- Sometimes referred to as "closed-box" diagramming
	- some industry publications refer to this methodology as the use of “closed-box diagramming”
	- notion of describing a system by its functionality and use without requiring any knowledge of how the system achieves that functionality
