## What is Systems Hardening?

Systems hardening is a collection of tools, techniques, and best practices to reduce vulnerability in technology applications, systems, infrastructure, firmware, and other areas. The goal of systems hardening is to reduce security risk by eliminating potential attack vectors and condensing the system’s attack surface. By removing superfluous programs, accounts functions, applications, ports, permissions, access, etc. attackers and malware have fewer opportunities to gain a foothold within your IT ecosystem.

Systems hardening demands a methodical approach to audit, identify, close, and control potential security vulnerabilities throughout your organization. There are several types of system hardening activities, including:
- Application hardening
    
- Operating system hardening
    
- Server hardening
    
- Endpoint hardening
    
- Database hardening
    
- Network hardening
    
Although the principles of system hardening are universal, specific tools and techniques vary depending on the type of hardening you are carrying out. System hardening is needed throughout the lifecycle of technology, from initial installation, through configuration, maintenance, and support, to end-of-life decommissioning. 
## How do you Harden a System?

You harden a system by reducing the “attack surface,” the combination of all the potential flaws and backdoors in technology can be exploited by [[Threat Actors]]. These vulnerabilities can occur in many ways. 
- **Default passwords** – Attackers can leverage [automated password crackers](https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/password-cracking-101-attacks-defenses-explained) to guess the defaults. The attack surface this presents could be large if the same defaults are used across many different endpoints--from desktops to IoT--or accounts.
  
- **Hardcoded passwords and other credentials stored in plain text files** can increase the attack surface in a couple important ways. If they are forgotten in deployed code or otherwise publicly exposed, the hardcoded credentials can provide a backdoor into the organization.
  
- **Unpatched software and firmware vulnerabilities** are historically one of the biggest contributors to attack surfaces. While patching will mitigate a vulnerability, patches are not always available as in the case of zero day threats. Moreover, some patches may be too disruptive to implement or not economically feasible.
  
- **Lack, or deficiency, of [privileged access controls](https://www.beyondtrust.com/resources/glossary/privileged-access-management-pam).** With the expansion of the cloud and all things digital transformation privileged accounts and access has exploded. The privileged account attack surface is not just humans and employees, but also increasingly involves machines and vendors. In cloud environments, privileged access and accounts may be dynamic and ephemeral, further complicating efforts to gain visibility and control over this massive risk.
  
- **Poorly configured BIOS, firewalls, ports, servers, switches, routers, or other parts of the infrastructure.** With the strong growth in cloud and hybrid infrastructure, IT environments are becoming increasingly complex. This complexity is fertile ground for misconfigurations not only can cause systems to crash or misfire, but also can create dangerous security holes. Misconfigurations like [open ports](https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/what-is-an-open-port-what-are-the-security-implications) have resulted in some of the worst cloud breaches in recent years, such as by inadvertently exposing data buckets or providing publicly accessible backdoors to critical infrastructure
  
- **Unencrypted, or inadequately encrypted, network traffic or data at rest** can make it easy for attackers to access data or eavesdrop on conversations and access and potentially gain important information (such as passwords) needed to advance an attack.
