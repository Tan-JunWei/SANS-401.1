>[!abstract] Benefits of network architecture understanding
>
>##### 1. Situational awareness
>It's true that we **can't secure what we are unaware of**, but even more importantly, understanding of assets that are **no longer required and subsequently removed** will result in the enforcement of **having only the assets necessary to the achievement of our organizational goals** (and nothing more). 
>
>
>##### 2. Prioritization of effort
>By knowing what assets we have, along with the **related criticality** of them, will allow for an **appropriate prioritization of effort**.
>
>
>##### 3. Reduced cost of effort
>By becoming aware of assets no longer required to be in operation, we can remove the assets that no longer contribute value. Hence, we need not dedicate **time, effort and attention** to non-essential assets any longer.
>
>##### 4. Timely detection of an attacker presence (Timely detection = timely response = reduction of damage)
>Understanding what **'normal'** looks like for an environment will surely cause the **'abnormal'** to stand out. The moment we notice abnormal is the moment we can move into **incident response**, which will then be the moment we start to **reduce the total amount of damage** that could be caused by the incident.
