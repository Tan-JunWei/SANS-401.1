If we had to identify the critical part of any organization’s IT environment, it would easily be the network. The network is where an organization’s productivity, mission, and success is achieved. It is also where an adversary’s productivity, mission, and success is achieved. 

Basically, the network is **equally important** to the **organisation** and the **adversary**.
