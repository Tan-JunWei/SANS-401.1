Securing a network requires knowledge of where each piece of valuable data resides. 
Our critical data may no longer be present only on critical systems alone.
- Data ends up in the most unusual locations
	- desktops of senior leadership
	- hard drives of system administrators
- External data networks also need to be evaluated
	- 'Unintentional' cloud: DropBox, OneDrive, etc.
