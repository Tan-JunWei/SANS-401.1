>The principle of least privileged is an important tenet of security. It is often used in the perspective of end-user access control where an end-user should **only have the necessary access to achieve their job functions, and nothing more**.

Least privilege is however, not limited to end-user access concepts alone. It is applied to every concept of security; an application should not have more access than required, a server should not have software that is not related to its functionality installed, etc.

>[!bug] Warning
>Without incorporating the principle of least privilege, organizations create over-privileged users or entities that increase the potential for breaches and misuse of critical systems and data (_What Is the Principle of Least Privilege?_, n.d.).

### Benefits of Principle of Least Privilege

- **Minimizes the attack surface**, diminishing avenues a malicious actor can use to access sensitive data or carry out an attack by protecting superuser and administrator privileges.

- **Reduces malware propagation** by not allowing users to install unauthorized applications. The principle of least privilege also stops lateral network movement that can launch an attack against other connected devices by limiting malware to the entry point.

- **Improves operational performance** with reductions in system downtime that might otherwise occur as a result of a breach, malware spread or incompatibility issues between applications.

- **Safeguards against human error** that can happen through mistake, malice or negligence. Recall: [[Human Errors]]
