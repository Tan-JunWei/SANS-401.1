>[!tip] What are threat agents?
>An individual, organization or group that is capable and motivated to carry out an attack of one sort or another. Different attacker groups target and attack different types of systems in different ways for different reasons (**motivation and intent**).
  
#### Key questions
- How active is each threat agent?
- How might a successful attack serve a particular threat agent's goals?

**"Opportunistic attacker"**
- looking for an easy target
- might leverage malicious websites, malvertising (malicious advertising), malicious emails, etc., to try and catch an unsuspecting victim

**Organized cybercrime**
- From ransomware to traditional extortion, there is a lot of money to be made by such an adversary

**Nation state actors (Advanced Persistent Threat)**
- highly capable adversaries, acting under the authority of a specific government or military organisation
- should not always be though of in terms of an incredibly capable actor
- should be thought of in the notion or idea that an adversary must maintain persistent access to an organisation (to achieve a long-term goal)
- in fact, all adversaries, to some degree, require the notion of persistence (surviving the restart of a computing system)

It should be noted that there isn't always a clear delineation between the category of attacker and methods used; this highlights how difficult it can be to separate tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP: see [[Threat Enumeration]]) as related to a categorization of an attacker.

While understanding the 'who' may be incredibly important, focusing not on the 'who' but instead on 'how' all adversaries must operate once they become present on the internal network (internal threat intelligence), might be even more important.
