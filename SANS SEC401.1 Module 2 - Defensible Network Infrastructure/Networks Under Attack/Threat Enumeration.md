- Threat enumeration is part of the overall concept known as [[Threat Intelligence]]
	- strives to help us understand TTP
	- can be focused on the "Who" is attacking an organization. One of the largest mistakes an organization could make is to assume they are not "worthy" of being attacked
	- more specific process compared to [[Threat Intelligence]] that involves identifying and listing all potential threats to an organizationâ€™s assets. 
	  
- Adversaries must know us better than we know ourselves
	- What an organization perceives as not being important, might be quite important to an adversary
	- attackers may have insights into an organization's systems, processes, and potential vulnerabilities that the organization itself may overlook
	  
- Defending against an adversary means the same in reverse
	- effective cybersecurity defense requires a deep understanding of offensive techniques
	- by thinking like an adversary, defenders can anticipate potential attacks and build more robust security measures to protect their systems
  
- Threat enumeration is a part of understanding the TTP (Tactics, Technique, Procedures)
	- tactics: high-level descriptions of a method an adversary might use to formulate an attack (what)
	- techniques: more detailed description of a specific instance of the tactic being attempted (how)
	- procedure: detailed explanation of how the technique works to implement that tactic of a given attack (how)
