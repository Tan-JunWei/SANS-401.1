Threat intelligence is **data that is collected, processed, and analyzed to understand a threat actor’s motives, targets, and attack behaviors**. Threat intelligence enables us to make faster, more informed, data-backed security decisions and change their behavior from reactive to proactive in the fight against [[Threat Actors]]

It involves understanding the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of cyber adversaries, as well as identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs) and emerging threat trends. The goal of threat intelligence is to provide actionable insights that can help organizations proactively defend against cyber threats.
