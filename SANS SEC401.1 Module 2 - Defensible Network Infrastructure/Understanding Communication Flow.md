Data is not just stored, it is accessed across the network. Data is processed across a network when applications and systems access it.

>- Data in transit

Communication flows means understanding:
- **Who** accesses data?
- **When** data is accessed?
- **How** much data is accessed?

This will lead to the development of baselines:
- Knowing **'normal'** allows **'abnormal'** to stand out (comparison)
- Data should only be accessed in the manner we **expect** (authorised access)
- Anything different from what we expect is **not only abnormal, but also likely adversarial**

If strong data access measures are put in place, abnormal situtations are considered suspicious and require immediate attention.

It is **never a 'one and done'**. Continual updating is necessary. The network is never static - it is **dynamic and everchanging**.
