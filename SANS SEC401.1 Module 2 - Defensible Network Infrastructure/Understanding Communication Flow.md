- Data is not just stored, it is accessed across the network. Data is processed across a network when applications and systems access it.
	- Communication flows means understanding:
		- Who accesses data?
		- When data is accessed?
		- How much data is accessed?
	- This will lead to the development of baselines:
		- Knowing 'normal' allows 'abnormal' to stand out
		- Data should only be accessed in the manner we expect
		- Anything different from what we expect is not only abnormal, but also likely adversarial
		  
- It is never a 'one and done'. Continual updating is necessary
	- The network is never static - it is dynamic and everchanging
