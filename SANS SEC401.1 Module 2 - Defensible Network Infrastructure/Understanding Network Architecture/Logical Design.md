The logical design represents the logical functions in the system.

>[!abstract]+ Logical Design
>Logical design:
>- Puts the conceptual design on paper
>	- After understanding why we have a network ([[Conceptual Design]]), the logical design is the facilitation of placing that understanding onto paper via the description provided through a network diagram.
>	- A network diagram typically includes:
>		- icons
>		- graphics to show workstations, servers, printers, scanners, routers, switches and other identified devices that connects to the network
>		  See also: [[Switch vs Router]]
>	- At this point, we are only focusing on the initial components identified using the [[Conceptual Design]] phase, but as we move forward, more detail and more devices will continue to be added to the diagram
>	  
>- Maps the components of the conceptual design via the use of a network diagram

The next steps of architecture understanding will leverage and build upon this design step.

>[!note] Note
>What we are NOT describing, at this point, are the **finely detailed aspects of the components** themselves. We are not discussing patch levels, hardening configurations, etc. This will occur in the next phase of the network architecture understanding ([[Physical Design]]).
