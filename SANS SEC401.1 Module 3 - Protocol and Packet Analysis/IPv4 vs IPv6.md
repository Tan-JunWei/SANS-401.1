IPv4 has some limitations, specifically in the number of unique addresses supported. While IPv4 accommodates **4.2 billion (2^32) unique 32-bit addresses**, the allocation of IP addresses on the internet was completed in the most efficient manner, leading to a **shortage of available IP addresses**.

There have been methods used to mitigate this shortage (Network Address Translation (NAT) and Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)). However, 4.2 billion addresses would still not be enough even with the most considerate use of available space. 

##### IPv4 vs IPv6 - What's the difference?

IPv6 has 128 bits of address space, which means it can accommodate 340 undecillion (2^128) addresses. This larger address also allows for greater flexibility in allocating addresses. Utilizing IPv6, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will be able to geographically assign IPv6 prefixes to different parts of the world, facilitating a simplification of routing traffic over the Internet. 

IPv6 allows for organizations, large and small, to obtain a IPv6 prefix with sufficient available addresses to accommodate all present and future addressing needs.
