The Internet Protocol (IP) is the basis for all communications on the internet. Its primary purpose is to assist with the transmission of packets between network endpoints, usually single hosts identified by unique addresses. 

IP...
- Works at the Internet Layer of the TCP/IP stack (network layer of the OSI model)
  
- Is a foundational protocol of the TCP/IP suite
  
- Assists with path determination for transmission of packets between endpoints on different networks
	- The information provided by IP assists in the determination of the 'best route' for a communication between 2 endpoints on 2 different networks.
	- While the information provided by IP aids in the above, IP itself is not responsible for a successful transmission along the entirety of the path.
	  
- Defines the formation of IP addresses, based upon network characteristics
