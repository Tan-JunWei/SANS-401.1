>A network protocol is nothing more than a **set of rules** dictating how computer networks communicate.

>It **establishes an agreement** between network entities (like hosts and servers) for **how** they will communicate.

In a nutshell, protocols define the format and the order of messages and the actions to be taken upon receipt of the messages. 

##### 3 Purposes for communication protocols
-  Standardize format of communication
-  Specify order or timing of communication
-  Protocols can be broken down into a protocol stack

### Protocol Stacks

Protocols are often described as part of a protocol stack, where **each layer of the stack receives a service from the layer above, and provides a service to the layer below**.
